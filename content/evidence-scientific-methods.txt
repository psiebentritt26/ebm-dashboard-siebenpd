## Consensus AI Search Strategy

### Research Question 1: Does wage/salary affect employee turnover or turnover intention?

**Consensus AI Query:** Does wage/salary affect employee turnover or turnover intention?
**Query Date:** 10/3/25
**Initial Studies Found:** 20
**Key Takeaways:** 
- Consistent evidence shows that higher wages or better compensation significantly and negatively affect turnover intention—meaning employees are less likely to want to leave when they are paid more or feel fairly compensated
- This relationship holds across various sectors, including manufacturing, services, mining, and hospitality, and in different countries
- Salary satisfaction and perceptions of fair compensation are key drivers in reducing turnover intention
- The effect of salary on turnover intention is often mediated by factors such as job satisfaction, employee engagement, and organizational commitment. Higher pay increases satisfaction and engagement, which further reduces turnover intention
- Other factors like work environment, leadership style, and career development also play important roles, but salary remains a significant independent predictor
- Wage inequality and unfavorable comparisons to internal or external reference wages can increase turnover intention, highlighting the importance of both absolute and relative pay 
- A few studies found the effect of compensation on turnover intention to be weak or insignificant in certain contexts, but these are outnumbered by studies showing a strong negative relationship
