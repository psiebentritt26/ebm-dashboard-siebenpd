# Practitioner Evidence: Methods & Acquisition Strategy
# Document your approach to gathering expert insights and professional experience

## Practitioner Evidence Goals
**Primary Goal:** [What practitioner insights do you need about your problem?]

## Acquisition Methods

### Expert Interviews
#### Interview Planning

- **Interview Length:** 10-15 minutes
- **Interview Method:** Semi-structured and informal (easiest to conduct given practitioner availability)

#### Interview Protocol

**Problem-Focused Questions:**
- Would you say that there exists a problem of high employee turnover among the transit/paratransit/school bus drivers?
- How often do you observe this problem?
- What would you say are the leading contributing factors to this problem?

**Solution-Focused Questions:**
- What would you say are the most effective interventions for combatting high driver turnover?
- Do these solutions already exist within the company or do they need to be implemented?
- What other interventions may potentially be effective?

**Implementation Questions:**
- In terms of existing interventions, how effective have they been thusfar?
- Are your proposed interventions financially feasible?

**Closing Questions:**
- Who else would you recommend I speak with about this?
- Is there anything else you would like to add?


## Documentation Strategy

### Interview Documentation
- **Recording:** Not recorded
- **Note-taking:** Basic notes on responses were taken


## Documentation & Availability Challenges

### Access Challenges
Mr. Gatobu and Mr. Johnson are often busy during the day. I also work night shifts when they are not in the office, making access
more challenging. 


### Quality Concerns
Possible existance of biases such as social desirability and selection biases.
Mr. Dave Johnson instructed me to consult Mr. Gatobu for further insight, although he was able to describe high driver turnover as an existing problem.

### Time Constraints
Time constraints hindered additional questions beyond those listed, meaning there may be valuable insights that were missed due to time constraints.
