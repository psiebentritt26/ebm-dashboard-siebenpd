## Expert Interview 2
### Practitioner Profile
- **Name/Title:** Dave Johnson, Transit Dispatch Superintendent
- **Organization:** Harrisonburg Department of Public Transportation
- **Experience:** 4+ years of experience with the organization
- **Industry Focus:** Staff scheduling and logistics coordination

### Problem-Related Insights
#### Problem Recognition
- **Problem Frequency:** Very common, especially for school bus drivers
- **Root Causes:** Driver fatigue, burnout

#### Problem Impact
- **Organizational Consequences:** Frequent route vacancies and delays as a result


### Specific Recommendations for Your Situation
Mr. Johnson was unable to provide concrete solutions to the issue, rather he provides evidence that the problem 
exists and has an effect on the organization as a whole. I was told Mr. Gatobu, who was consulted above, was the best
source of information pertaining to the problem and a possible solution.

## Cross-Expert Analysis

### Consensus Views
#### About the Problem
High turnover plagues almost all sectors of the transportation industry, including public transportation and school bus transportation.
The stressful nature of the job and burnout seem to be the leading indicators of turnover in this sector

#### About Solutions
Since only Mr. Gatobu was able to provide possible solutions, the most evident solutions to the problem would be
benefits packages, provided they are frequently communicated to employees


#### Contextual Differences
Since this evidence details accounts of public transportation practitioners, there is a contextual difference.
However, the nature of the job and long hours on the road are consistent across both contexts.

#### Trade-offs
The practitioners emphasize balancing the costs of enhanced benefits packages against the costs of constant turnover (recruiting, training, route delays, service quality impacts).

## Connection to Logic Model

**Logic Model:** Compensation [X] → Productivity [Mediator 1] → Organizational Commitment [Mediator 2] → Staff Turnover [Y]

### Evidence Mapping to Logic Model Components

#### **[X] Independent Variable: Compensation**

**Practitioner Evidence:**
- ✅ **Gerald Gatobu identifies compensation as a retention tool**
  - "Cost of living adjustments to compensation" mentioned as successful intervention
  - Benefits packages (vacation time, PTO, sick leave) are forms of total compensation
  - Emphasis on "communicating their value to employees" suggests compensation perception matters

**Connection to Logic Model:**
- Gatobu's experience confirms that compensation (both wages and benefits) is a lever managers can pull to address turnover
- The emphasis on **communicating value** suggests compensation must be *perceived* as fair and competitive, not just objectively high
- Sick leave implementation is recent and showing positive effects, supporting the idea that compensation improvements can reduce turnover

**Alignment with Trucking Context:**
- Public transit drivers face similar compensation challenges as trucking (long hours, demanding work)
- Benefits may be even more important in trucking where drivers spend days/weeks away from home
- Cost of living adjustments parallel the need for competitive wages in trucking industry

---

#### **[Mediator 1] Productivity**

**Practitioner Evidence:**
- ⚠️ **Limited direct evidence, but implicit connections:**
  - Route delays and vacancies caused by turnover/absenteeism directly reduce productivity
  - Constant need to "mitigate the problem" diverts management attention from service improvements
  - Supervisors covering routes = taking them away from their normal duties (productivity loss)

**Connection to Logic Model:**
- While practitioners don't explicitly discuss productivity gains from better compensation, they describe productivity *losses* from turnover
- **Reverse logic:** High turnover → route vacancies → supervisors covering routes → reduced management productivity → operational inefficiency
- Stable workforce (achieved through better compensation/benefits) → fewer disruptions → higher organizational productivity

**Gap in Evidence:**
- Practitioners don't explicitly state "better benefits → higher driver productivity"
- However, they do indicate: "driver burnout/fatigue" → turnover, suggesting that addressing burnout (through better benefits, time off) could improve productivity

**Potential Mechanism (inferred):**
- Better benefits (especially sick leave, PTO) → drivers can rest and recover → less burnout → better performance/productivity when working
- Flexible scheduling → better work-life balance → reduced fatigue → higher productivity per hour worked

---

#### **[Mediator 2] Organizational Commitment**

**Practitioner Evidence:**
- ✅ **Strong implicit evidence through burnout/stress discussion:**
  - **Gatobu:** "Driver burnout, stressful and mentally taxing nature of the job" causes turnover
  - **Johnson:** "Driver fatigue, burnout" are root causes
  - Benefits packages described as retention tools, suggesting they build commitment

**Connection to Logic Model:**
- **Burnout is the opposite of organizational commitment**
  - Burned out drivers = low commitment = high turnover likelihood
  - Addressing burnout through benefits = building commitment
  
- **Benefits → Commitment pathway:**
  - Sick leave implementation → employees feel cared for → organizational commitment increases
  - "Communicating value of benefits" → employees feel valued/respected → commitment strengthens
  - Vacation time/PTO → work-life balance improves → job satisfaction → commitment

**Mechanism Supported by Practitioner Evidence:**
- Compensation/Benefits [X] → Reduced burnout & improved well-being → Organizational Commitment [Mediator 2] → Lower Turnover [Y]
- The "stressful and mentally taxing" nature creates low commitment; benefits counter this stress

**Key Insight from Gatobu:**
- Benefits must be **communicated** to have effect on commitment
- This suggests commitment is about *perceived* organizational support, not just objective benefits
- Aligns with organizational commitment theory: employees stay when they feel organization invests in them

#### **[Y] Dependent Variable: Staff Turnover**

**Practitioner Evidence:**
- ✅ **Very strong confirmation that turnover problem exists:**
  - **Gatobu:** "Widespread issue, frequently affects normal operations"
  - **Johnson:** "Very common, especially for school bus drivers"
  - Both practitioners independently confirm high turnover is a persistent problem

**Connection to Logic Model:**
- Turnover is the outcome variable both practitioners are trying to address
- **Evidence of turnover severity:**
  - Route delays and vacancies (operational impact)
  - Constant mitigation efforts required (consumes resources)
  - Decreased passenger satisfaction (external stakeholder impact)
  - Frequent service complaints (quality deterioration)
  - Reduced funding (long-term organizational viability threat)

**Turnover Drivers Identified:**
- Driver burnout (proximate cause)
- Stressful/mentally taxing work (working conditions)
- Fatigue (physical/mental exhaustion)
- Absenteeism as precursor to turnover (warning signal)

### Logic Model Pathway Support from Practitioner Evidence

#### **Supported Pathway:**
**Compensation/Benefits [X] → Organizational Commitment [Mediator 2] → Turnover [Y]**

**Evidence Chain:**
1. ✅ Benefits packages and compensation adjustments reduce turnover (Gatobu's direct experience)
2. ✅ Burnout/stress causes turnover (both practitioners agree)
3. ✅ Benefits (sick leave, PTO, vacation) address burnout → build commitment
4. ✅ Higher commitment (feeling valued, supported) → lower turnover

**Strength:** Strong practitioner consensus that benefits work, with clear mechanism (reducing burnout/building commitment)

---

#### **Partially Supported Pathway:**
**Compensation [X] → Productivity [Mediator 1] → Turnover [Y]**

**Evidence Chain:**
1. ⚠️ Turnover causes productivity losses (route vacancies, supervisor time diverted) - **confirmed**
2. ⚠️ Better compensation reduces turnover - **confirmed by Gatobu**
3. ❓ Better compensation directly increases individual driver productivity - **not directly addressed**
4. ⚠️ Higher productivity leads to lower turnover - **mechanism unclear in practitioner evidence**

**Strength:** Weak to moderate. Evidence shows turnover *reduces* productivity, but doesn't clearly show that productivity improvements reduce turnover. The pathway may exist but isn't explicitly validated by practitioners.

---

#### **Alternative Pathway Suggested by Evidence:**
**Compensation [X] → Burnout Reduction → Commitment [Mediator 2] → Turnover [Y]**

This pathway bypasses productivity as primary mediator and focuses on well-being/commitment:
- Better benefits (sick leave, PTO) → drivers can rest/recover → less burnout
- Less burnout → higher job satisfaction and organizational commitment
- Higher commitment → lower turnover intention → reduced actual turnover

**This aligns more closely with what Gatobu and Johnson describe.**

### Practical Implications from Practitioner Evidence

**Actionable Insights:**
1. ✅ **Implement comprehensive benefits packages** - Gatobu's #1 recommendation
2. ✅ **Include sick leave specifically** - recently implemented with positive effects
3. ✅ **Make cost-of-living wage adjustments** - Gatobu confirms effectiveness
4. ✅ **Communicate benefits value frequently** - not just providing benefits but ensuring awareness
5. ⚠️ **Consider flexible scheduling as supplement** - helps but less impactful than benefits
6. ✅ **Target burnout directly** - address root cause (mental/physical stress) not just symptoms

**Implementation Lessons:**
- Benefits must be *perceived* as valuable (communication critical)
- Multiple benefit types may have additive effects (sick leave + PTO + vacation)
- Flexibility alone is insufficient; must be combined with strong benefits
- Addressing well-being/burnout is key mechanism for building commitment
