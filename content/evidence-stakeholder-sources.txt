## Cross-Stakeholder Analysis

### Areas of Agreement
- Driver retention/turnover is an ongoing issue
- Biggest contributing factors relate to the nature of the job
- Best solutions would be better benefits, safety standards, and more support from management

### Areas of Disagreement/Tension
- Some drivers agree that some safety standards are more detrimental than helpful and may contribute to turnover

---

## Ethical Impacts

### Worker Well-Being and Safety
- Benefits would help drivers balance work and family life more effectively
- Better safety regulations would improve health and job safety

### Fairness and Equity
- Proposed solutions would benefit drivers greatly, but additional benefits programs and safety regulations may be costly for employers
- Reducing the entrance age to 18: May be unfair for younger drivers to be subjected to harsh job conditions

### Transparency and Communication
- Benefits must be consistently communicated to employees
- Policy changes and new mandates must also be clearly communicated and effectively implemented
- Frequent communication with drivers overall strengthens solutions


---

## Practical Impacts

### Implementation Feasibility
- Tighter profit margins in the industry may make some solutions tougher to implement
- New safety policies can easily be implemented

### Power to influence decisions
- Company managers have biggest impact, since they can directly implement interventions
- Supply chain managers' support/opposition can hinder implementation efforts
- Partnered shipping companies have less influence, but can cut contracts depending on how they weigh the turnover issue
- Drivers/employees have little power, but can voice concerns through an effective justice system
