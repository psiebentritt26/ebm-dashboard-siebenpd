## Key Statistics Summary by Logic Model Component

### **Compensation [X] → Turnover [Y] Relationship**
| Metric | Value | Key Insight |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Mean Hourly Wage | $29.02/hr | Slightly below U.S. average ($29.92/hr) |
| Wage Growth (YoY) | +6.0% | Outpacing inflation, but turnover remains high |
| Weekly Earnings | $1,309/week | 7% above private sector average |
| Annual Turnover Rate | ~38.4% | High despite competitive wages |
| Voluntary Quits Rate | ~24% annually | Majority of turnover is voluntary |

**Interpretation:** Despite above-average and growing wages, turnover remains high (38.4% annually). This suggests compensation alone is insufficient - supporting need to examine mediating factors (productivity, commitment).

---

### **Compensation [X] → Productivity [Mediator 1]**
| Metric | Value | Key Insight |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Mean Hourly Wage | $29.02/hr | Wide distribution ($21-$38/hr) |
| Labor Productivity Growth | +3.4% YoY | Strong productivity gains |
| Average Weekly Hours | 40.6 hours | Consistently full-time work |
| Employment Level Change | -1.1% YoY | Declining workforce despite demand |

**Interpretation:** Productivity is growing (+3.4%) even as employment declines and turnover remains high. Higher-paid workers may be more productive, but turnover disrupts productivity potential. The 40.6 hours/week (vs. 34.3 national average) suggests compensation may relate to longer hours/higher output per worker.

---

### **Productivity [Mediator 1] → Organizational Commitment [Mediator 2]**
| Metric | Value | Key Insight |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Median Tenure | 3.4 years | 17% lower than all occupations (4.1 years) |
| Short Tenure (<1 year) | 19.3% of workforce | ~1 in 5 workers are new hires |
| Job Openings Rate | 5.8 per 100 employees | Higher than national average (5.3) |
| Injury Rate | 4.4 per 100 FTE | 63% higher than private sector average |

**Interpretation:** Lower tenure and high proportion of new workers suggest lower organizational commitment. Difficult working conditions (high injury rates, long hours) may reduce commitment despite productivity demands. Constant recruitment needs (5.8% openings) indicate commitment issues.

---

### **Organizational Commitment [Mediator 2] → Turnover [Y]**
| Metric | Value | Key Insight |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Median Tenure | 3.4 years | Lower commitment = higher exit likelihood |
| Separations Rate | 3.2% monthly | Constant workforce churn |
| Hires Rate | 3.2% monthly | Replacement hiring equals departures |
| Union Membership | 16.0% | Higher than average - seeking voice/protection |

**Interpretation:** Short tenure correlates with high turnover. The 3.2% monthly separations rate (matching hires) indicates a "revolving door" pattern. Higher unionization (16% vs. 10% national) may reflect workers seeking commitment mechanisms or protections - or dissatisfaction driving union activity.

## Cross-Sectional Patterns Supporting Logic Model

### **Pattern 1: Wage-Turnover Paradox**
- **Observation:** Trucking wages ($29.02/hr, $68K annually) are competitive and growing (+6% YoY), yet turnover remains extremely high (38.4% annually)
- **Logic Model Implication:** Compensation alone is insufficient to reduce turnover - mediating factors (productivity demands, commitment) must be addressed
- **Supporting Statistics:**
  - Wages 7% above private sector average
  - Voluntary quits rate: 2.0% monthly (workers choosing to leave)
  - 340,000 unfilled job openings despite unemployment

### **Pattern 2: Productivity-Hours Trade-off**
- **Observation:** Workers average 40.6 hours/week (18% above national 34.3), productivity is growing (+3.4%), but tenure is low (3.4 years median)
- **Logic Model Implication:** High productivity demands and long hours may erode organizational commitment, increasing turnover despite higher pay
- **Supporting Statistics:**
  - 40.6 weekly hours vs. 34.3 national average
  - Injury rate 4.4 per 100 FTE (63% above average)
  - 19.3% of workforce has <1 year tenure

### **Pattern 3: The "Replacement Treadmill"**
- **Observation:** Hires rate (3.2%) exactly matches separations rate (3.2%) monthly - companies constantly replacing workers but not growing
- **Logic Model Implication:** Low organizational commitment creates perpetual turnover cycle; new hires leave before developing commitment
- **Supporting Statistics:**
  - 3.2% monthly hires = 3.2% monthly separations (zero net growth)
  - Employment declined 1.1% despite 340,000 job openings
  - Nearly 1 in 5 workers (19.3%) have less than 1 year tenure

## Data Quality & Limitations Assessment

### Strengths:
- ✅ Large sample sizes (JOLTS: 21,000 establishments; OEWS: 1.1M establishments)
- ✅ Government-verified data with rigorous methodology
- ✅ Time series available for trend analysis
- ✅ Industry-specific breakdowns (NAICS 484)
- ✅ Multiple complementary data sources for triangulation

### Limitations:
- ⚠️ **Organizational commitment not directly measured** - using proxy variables (tenure, unionization, injuries)
- ⚠️ **Aggregated industry data** - cannot isolate individual company practices
- ⚠️ **Observational data only** - cannot prove causation (correlation ≠ causation)
- ⚠️ **No "why" context** - numbers don't explain reasons for turnover decisions
- ⚠️ **Lag times** - some data is 6-18 months old (OEWS: May 2024; Tenure: Jan 2024)
- ⚠️ **Confounding variables** - many factors affect turnover beyond compensation/productivity/commitment

### Recommendations for Logic Model Testing:
1. **Combine with scientific evidence** (experiments/RCTs) to establish causality
2. **Collect primary data** on organizational commitment through surveys
3. **Use time-series regression** to test relationships controlling for confounders
4. **Supplement with qualitative evidence** (practitioner interviews) for "why" explanations
5. **Acknowledge limitations** - organizational data shows patterns, not proof

## Synthesis of Organizational Evidence

### Strongest Evidence for Problem Existence
The organizational data unequivocally demonstrates a severe turnover problem in trucking:
- **38.4% annual turnover rate** (3.2% monthly separations) - nearly 4 in 10 workers leave each year
- **24% voluntary annual quits** - majority of turnover is workers choosing to leave (not layoffs)
- **19.3% of workforce has <1 year tenure** - constant influx of new, inexperienced workers
- **Hires rate = separations rate** (both 3.2%) - "revolving door" pattern with zero net workforce growth
- **340,000 unfilled job openings** (5.8 per 100 employees) - difficulty replacing departing workers

### Strongest Evidence for Solution Feasibility  
The data suggests compensation-focused solutions are **necessary but insufficient**:
- **Wage growth (+6% YoY) has not reduced turnover** - indicates multi-factor problem
- **Wages are competitive** ($29.02/hr, 7% above private sector average) - baseline already reasonable
- **Wide wage distribution** ($21-$38/hr) - room to reward high performers
- **Productivity gains (+3.4% YoY)** - industry can afford wage investments
- **High injury rates (4.4 per 100 FTE)** and **long hours (40.6/week)** - non-wage factors matter

**Implication:** Solutions must address compensation AND working conditions, commitment mechanisms, and productivity demands.

### Evidence-Based Organizational Readiness Assessment
**Moderate-to-High readiness for interventions:**
- ✅ **Financial capacity exists** - productivity growing, wages already competitive
- ✅ **Problem is measurable** - clear turnover metrics to track intervention success
- ⚠️ **Cultural/systemic barriers** - 40.6 hour weeks, injury rates, low tenure suggest deep-rooted issues
- ⚠️ **Industry-wide problem** - not just one company, requiring broad solutions
- ✅ **Worker voice mechanisms** - 16% unionization provides feedback channels

### Critical Success Factors Based on Organizational Evidence
1. **Multi-Pronged Approach Required:** Data shows compensation alone is insufficient (wages up 6%, turnover unchanged)
2. **Retention Metrics Must Improve:** Focus on increasing median tenure from 3.4 to 4+ years
3. **Address Working Conditions:** Reduce injury rates (currently 63% above average) and long hours (40.6/week)
4. **Target First-Year Retention:** 19.3% have <1 year tenure - critical intervention window
5. **Measure Commitment Proxies:** Track tenure, engagement surveys, injury rates as leading indicators
6. **Test Interventions With Data:** Use monthly turnover data to assess if solutions work within 3-6 months

---

## Next Steps for Logic Model Testing

### Recommended Analyses:
1. **Correlation Analysis:** Test statistical relationships between compensation, productivity, commitment proxies, and turnover
2. **Time-Series Regression:** Use monthly/quarterly data to examine lagged effects (does wage increase in Month 1 reduce turnover in Month 3?)
3. **Comparative Analysis:** Compare high-wage vs. low-wage segments to see if turnover differs
4. **Triangulation:** Combine with scientific evidence (RCTs from literature) to establish causality

### Data Gaps to Address:
- ❌ **Direct organizational commitment measures** - consider primary survey data
- ❌ **Company-specific practices** - supplement with practitioner interviews
- ❌ **Causal mechanisms** - use scientific literature for experimental evidence
- ❌ **Contextual factors** - collect stakeholder perspectives on "why" turnover occurs
