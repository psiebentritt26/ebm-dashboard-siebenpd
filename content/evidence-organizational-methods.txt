# Organizational Evidence: Internal Data Collection Strategy
# Document your approach to gathering internal organizational evidence

## Logic Model
**Compensation [X] → Productivity [Mediator] → Organizational Commitment [Mediator] → Staff Turnover [Y]**

## Internal Evidence Goals
**Primary Goal:** Gather industry-level data demonstrating the turnover problem in trucking and relationships between compensation, productivity, organizational commitment, and turnover rates
**Secondary Goal:** Identify baseline metrics and trends to assess feasibility of compensation-based retention interventions

## Data Collection Plan

### AI Collection Method
- **Model Used:** Claude Sonnet 4.5 (Ask and Agent Mode)
- **Prompts Used:** 
               1.  I'm studying the impact of employee pay/compensation on turnover in the trucking industry. 
                   My preliminary logic model is that compensation [x] -> productivity [mediator]->organizational commitmemnt[mediator]->staff turnover. 
                   Please search professional data repositories (BLS, USA Facts, World Bank, government databases) and suggest specific datasets with variables related to my logic model. 
                   Include the URL and tell me what variables are in each dataset
               2. Can you evaluate any possible barriers from the following: 
                  1. Absence of a logic model
                  2. Irrelevant data
                  3. Inaccurate data
                  4. Missing contextual information
                  5. Measurement errors
                  6. Small number problem
                  7. Confusing percentages/averages
                  8. Misleading graphs
                  9. Correlations/regressions/overfitting
                  10. Wide confidence intervals
