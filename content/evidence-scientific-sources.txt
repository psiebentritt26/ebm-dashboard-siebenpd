### Citation
Dalton, D. R., & Mesch, D. J. (1990). The Impact of Flexible Scheduling on
          Employee Attendance and Turnover. Administrative Science Quarterly, 35(2),
          370–387. https://doi.org/10.2307/2393395

### Study Overview
- **Research Design:** Non-randomized controlled study
- **Sample Size:** 137 employees in experimental group, 134 in control group
**134 employees remained in experimental group and 140 employees in control group upon conclusion**
- **Population:** White-collar, hourly, service-oriented employees
- **Setting:** A large western public utility company
- **Duration:** ~6 year observation period, 1 year intervention period

### Key Findings
#### Related to Your Problem
- Employee turnover could also be affected by external factors such as economic conditions
- Reduced alternative employment opportunities may also lead to a decreased employee turnover rate

#### Related to Your Solution
- Flexible scheduling interventions had minimal to no effect on employee turnover throughout the study.
- Employee turnover may also be a reaction to work environment and/or work content.

#### Important Statistics/Results
- 6.9 % reduction in employee turnover for experimental group (through ARIMA time-series analysis)
- 7.4 % reduction in turnover for control group (through ARIMA time-series analysis)
- Reductions not attributed to flexible scheduling intervention because control group concurrently experienced turnover reduction.

### Relevance Assessment
- **Problem Relevance:** High - Addresses alternative factors pertaining to turnover
- **Solution Relevance:** Medium - Discusses effect of flexible scheduling on turnover, but could've presented more effect sizes.
- **Context Similarity:** Moderate similarity. Service-oriented employees in a public agency, but different work conditions from transportation industry

## Additional Studies Summary

### Study 4: Meta-analytic evidence on flexible work practices
- **Citation:** Onken-Menke, G., Nüesch, S., & Kröll, C. (2018). Are you attracted? Do you
          remain? Meta-analytic evidence on flexible work practices. Business Research,
          11(2), 239–277. https://doi.org/10.1007/s40685-017-0059-6

- **Study Type:** Meta-analysis/systematic review

- **Key Statistics: 
    - Correlation between flexible work schedule and turnover intention: r = -0.05, p = -0.05 (p < 0.05) (N = 11,051)
    - Correlation between telecommuting and turnover intention: r = -0.10, p = -0.10 (p < 0.01) (N = 6010)
- **Relevance:** 
    - Both correlations statistically significant given larger sample sizes
    - Can infer that flexible work practices (scheduling, telecommuting, etc.) can have an ample effect on employee turnover


### Study 5: The Impact of Procedural Justice on Employee Turnover and the Role of two Mediators
- **Citation:** O’Callaghan, M. (2024). The impact of procedural justice on employee turnover
          intentions and the role of two mediators. Organization Management Journal
          (Emerald Publishing ), 21(2), 75–87. https://doi.org/10.1108/OMJ-03-2023-1822

- **Key Statistics & Findings:**
    - Correlation of procedural justice and intention to leave (turnover): p = 0.013 (N = 439 participants)
        - LLC/ULC (95% Cl): -0.265/-0.028
    - Correlation of procedural justice and intention to leave **w/meaningful work mediator**: p = 0.018
        - LLC/ULC (95% Cl): -0.132/-0.017
    - Findings indicate meaningful work has large impact on turnover intentions, especially when mediating procedural justics->intent to leave link
- **Relevance:**
    - Study describes noticable impact of fair procedural justice practices on intention to leave
    - Also details meaningful work as a mediator in this relationship and as a predictor of turnover intentions

## Cross-Study Analysis

### Consistent Findings

#### About the Problem
- A combination of internal AND external factors may be responsible for employee turnover issues across different industries

#### About Solutions (AI Assistance used - Claude Sonnet 4.5)
- **Compensation increases reduce turnover, but the relationship is complex**: Higher wages show negative correlation with turnover (Study 1: r = -0.15; Study 2: r = -0.29), but excessively high wages may backfire, suggesting an optimal compensation range rather than "more is always better"
- **Commitment and satisfaction are key mediators**: Pay satisfaction and affective commitment significantly predict turnover intention (Study 2: β = -0.77), indicating compensation works primarily by building organizational commitment rather than through direct financial incentive alone
- **Flexible scheduling has limited direct impact**: Multiple studies show flexible work practices have minimal effect on turnover (Study 3: no significant difference between experimental and control groups; Study 4 meta-analysis: r = -0.05), suggesting scheduling flexibility should supplement rather than replace compensation-based strategies
- **Procedural justice and meaningful work matter**: Fair treatment and perceived meaningfulness of work significantly affect turnover intentions (Study 5: p = 0.013), highlighting that how compensation is determined and communicated may be as important as the amount itself

### Connection to Proposed Logic Model (AI Assistance used - Claude Sonnet 4.5)

**Logic Model:** Compensation [X] → Productivity [Mediator 1] → Organizational Commitment [Mediator 2] → Staff Turnover [Y]

#### **Evidence Support for Logic Model Components:**

**[X → Y] Direct Effect: Compensation → Turnover**
- ✅ **Strongly Supported**: Studies 1 and 2 demonstrate direct negative correlations between compensation and turnover
  - Study 1 (Al-Azzam & Obeidat): r = -0.15, p < 0.05 (wages → turnover)
  - Study 2 (A'yuninnisa & Saptoto): r = -0.29, p < 0.05 (pay satisfaction → turnover intention)
- **Implication**: Compensation alone can reduce turnover, but effect sizes are modest (-0.15 to -0.29), suggesting mediation pathways are important

**[X → Mediator 2 → Y] Pathway: Compensation → Organizational Commitment → Turnover**
- ✅ **Strongly Supported**: Study 2 provides direct evidence of this pathway
  - Affective commitment strongly predicts turnover intention: β = -0.77, p < 0.05
  - Pay satisfaction affects commitment, which in turn affects turnover
  - Study 1 notes "higher wages generally lead to increased job satisfaction and commitment"
- **Implication**: This is the **primary mechanism** - compensation builds commitment (feeling valued, satisfied), which reduces turnover. The large effect size (β = -0.77) suggests commitment is a powerful mediator.

**[Mediator 1] Productivity as Mediator**
- ⚠️ **Limited/Unclear Support**: 
  - Study 1 warns "higher wages may not signal higher productivity"
  - No studies directly test whether productivity mediates compensation → turnover relationship
  - Study 3 found external economic factors (reduced alternative employment) affected turnover independently of performance
- **Implication**: Productivity pathway has **weak empirical support** in this evidence base. Commitment pathway appears more central.

**[Alternative Mediators Suggested by Studies]:**
- **Meaningful work** (Study 5): Mediates procedural justice → turnover (p = 0.018)
- **Pay satisfaction** (Study 2): Mediates actual pay → commitment → turnover
- **Procedural justice** (Study 5): Fair processes independently affect turnover (p = 0.013)

#### **Revised Logic Model Based on Scientific Evidence:**

The studies suggest a **modified model** may better reflect reality:

**Primary Pathway (Strongly Supported):**
Compensation [X] → Pay Satisfaction & Commitment [Mediator] → Turnover [Y]

**Supporting Factors:**
- Procedural Justice (how compensation is determined) → Commitment
- Meaningful Work → Commitment
- External Economic Conditions → Turnover (moderator)

**Weak/Unsupported Pathway:**
Compensation → Productivity → Turnover (minimal evidence in these studies)

#### **Key Insights for Trucking Industry Application:**

1. **Focus on commitment-building, not just wage levels**: Study 2's β = -0.77 for commitment → turnover suggests that building driver commitment through fair compensation, communication of benefits, and procedural justice may be more effective than simply raising wages

2. **Optimal compensation range exists**: Study 1's non-linear findings (r = 0.0016 for quadratic term) suggest diminishing returns or even negative effects from excessive compensation - focus on competitive, fair wages rather than industry-leading maximums

3. **Flexible scheduling is supplementary, not primary**: Studies 3 and 4 show weak effects (r = -0.05), suggesting flexible scheduling should complement compensation strategies rather than replace them

4. **Communication and fairness matter**: Study 5's procedural justice findings emphasize that *how* compensation decisions are made and communicated affects turnover as much as the amounts themselves

5. **Context matters**: Study 3 found economic conditions affected turnover independent of interventions - trucking companies should monitor labor market tightness and adjust strategies accordingly
